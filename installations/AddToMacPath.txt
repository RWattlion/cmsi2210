Adding a directory to the Mac O/S search path
=============================================
1.  Determine the directory in which the program you are adding 'resides'
2.  Open a terminal window and type the name of the program.  If you DON'T
      get a response saying
         "command not found: <program-you-typed>"
      the program is already in the search path.  You're done.

3.  type "cd" and press "enter".  This will return you to your "normal"
      working directory [also called your 'home' directory] in the terminal
      window.
4.  type "echo $SHELL" and press "enter".  This will tell you which "shell"
      you are using.  Things are case-sensitive so be aware.  It matters what
      shell you are using as to which file you create/edit next.
5.  type "ls -al" and press "enter".  This will show you all the files in
      your home directory in 'long' format.  Because of the "-a" you will be
      able to see files beginning with a dot ["."]
6.  look for a file called either ".bash_profile" or ".zprofile" in the list,
      depending upon if you are running the bash or z shell, respectively.
      If it doesn't exist you will need to create one and add the search path
      to it using these steps.  If it DOES exist, skip to step 9.
7.  if the last command responded with "/bin/bash" you are on the bash shell;
      if it responded with "/bin/zsh" you are on the "z" shell.  Note that it
      is the last word that is important here....
8.  type "touch .bash_profile" if you are on bash, or "touch .zprofile" if
      you are on zsh.  This will create an empty file with the name you have
      typed.
9.  type "vi .bash_profile" or "vi .zprofile" to edit the file using the "vi"
      editor.  If you have another editor you are familiar with using in the
      terminal, feel free to use that one instead.  You will still need to
      add the line in the next step.
10. when the "vi" editor opens, press the "a" key to "append" [if this is a
      new file] and type [or copy and paste] the following line into the vi
      window:

         PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/nasm-2.15.05        # this will add 'nasm'

      then press the "escape" key to exit "append" mode.  NOTE: the path you
      added should be the directory where your program is installed, that you
      determined in step 1.
11. press the "colon" key [":"] and observe that the colon character appears
      at the BOTTOM LEFT MARGIN of the window.
12. type "wq" for "write and quit" to save the file.  The "vi" editor exits.
13. type "ls -al" again to make sure the ".bash_profile" or ".zprofile" file
      has a file size that is not zero.
14. type "source ./.bash_profile" or "source ./.zprofile" to pick up the new
      changes to your search path.  Use "echo $PATH" to see the entire path;
      you should see your new added path in the results.
15. type the name of the program that you are trying to add, like 'nasm' or
      'gcc' and press "enter".  You should see the program's response.

DONE!!!
